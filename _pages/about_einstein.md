Hi, I'm Nadia Regli, a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from the University of Queensland and a Technology Consultant at Ernst & Young. I specialise in robotics and software engineering, with a strong focus on developing innovative, real-world solutions that improve lives.

My background spans hands-on robotics projects and full-stack software development. At Universal Field Robots, I contributed to building an autonomous underground mining robot using ROS II, C++ and Python. My honours thesis explored enhancing LiDAR SLAM localisation in feature-deficient environments using Doppler velocity data, an experience that deepened my passion for robotics perception and elegant control systems.

Currently, at EY, I work as a full-stack developer on a major Australian health insurance platform, implementing complex user-facing and backend features using Vue.js and C#. I collaborate across CMS and EAI teams, fix defects raised by QA, and manage codebases using Git and Azure DevOps.

My approach is thoughtful, organised, and proactive. I enjoy contributing to high-impact projects and collaborating with driven, purpose-led teams, especially in robotics, where technology directly improves how we live and work.

Letâ€™s build something meaningful together.
